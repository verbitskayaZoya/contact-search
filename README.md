## Features
The app displays all the data from your db and the search pattern functionality allows to find the items that match your input. 

## How to use the application
1. You can import your data or use mine as an example.
2. Enter a word or partial word in the input field to see matching items, ignoring case sensitivity.
3. The input field gets cleared when focused so just type your next inquiry.

## Technologies used 
1. HTML and CSS
2. Javascript ES 6+

## Challenges and learning points
1. Using regex was the biggest challenge so I figured out how to make first character of each word (due to the combination of \b and \w), and convert them to uppercase.
